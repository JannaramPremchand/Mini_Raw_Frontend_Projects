          <strong>Dear SG,</strong>
          <br/>
          I hope this letter finds you well. I've been thinking about you a lot lately, and I just wanted to reach out and share what's been on my mind.
          <br/>
          I miss you. I miss the way we used to laugh together, the way we understood each other without even speaking. The memories we created together are still so vivid in my heart, and I find myself reminiscing about the beautiful moments we shared.
          <br/>
          I hope you are doing well and finding joy in the little things. You deserve all the happiness in the world.
          <br/>
          Take care.
